# AI-Powered Job Application Evaluator (Power Platform Solution)

This Power Apps solution allows organizations to evaluate job applicants using AI. It compares the applicant's resume to the job description and generates a recommendation using AI Builder. It is a simple but full solution to track candidates, and can be modified as desired. (unmanaged solution) 

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the solution running:

1. **Create a Job Opening**
   - Fill out the **Job Description** field carefully. This will be used to assess applicants.

2. **Create a Job Application**
   - Fill out all required fields.
   - Paste the applicant‚Äôs resume into the **Resume Text** field.

3. **Save the Record**
   - Saving the application triggers a Power Automate flow.

   - After about one minute, refresh the application record.
   - The **AI Generated Recommendation** field should now be populated.
